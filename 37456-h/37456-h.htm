<p class="center fb4 p6">HOW TO KNIT KNICKERBOCKER STOCKINGS</p>

<p class="center fb1 p4">GENERAL DIRECTIONS</p>

<p>The difficulty in giving knitting directions arises from no two people
knitting alike. Some do so too loosely, others too tightly. In good
work the loops should just run easily on the needles.</p>

<p>In order to secure your stocking being the right size, it will be well
before you start it to test your knitting by casting on 8 stitches and
knitting 8 rows. If, with Alloa yarn and No. 12 needles, the knitting
measures about a square inch, your stocking will work out medium size.
If, however, the square is much larger or smaller, then alter the size
of needles to suit your knitting, taking bigger or smaller needles as
required. <i>This is a very important point to attend to.</i> The
directions given are for a medium-sized stocking, both in length and
width. Any one who has knitted a stocking by them will see at <i>once</i>
how easy it is to enlarge or diminish the size.</p>

<p class="center p2"><i>How to join Wool</i></p>

<p>Never make a knot, but knit a few stitches with both wools. The extra
thickness never shows, and the ends may be cut off close with
impunity.</p>

<p class="center p2"><i>Raising</i></p>

<p>It is helpful and saves much counting, if, when you raise or decrease,
you knit along with the wool, on that stitch <i>only</i>, a piece of fine
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>white wool or thread. It is easily withdrawn afterwards, but it
enables you to see at a glance which is your back needle, and the last
time you raised or decreased.</p>

<p>You <i>raise</i>, by putting your needle before knitting next stitch
through the loop below, in reality the stitch of the last round, and
drawing the wool through it. You must be very careful not to make a
hole, a slight twist as you take up the stitch prevents this.</p>

<p class="center p2"><i>Tops in Fingering</i></p>

<p>When you knit with two wools, carrying them on at the back, the
knitting is much more even if one colour, say the dark, is knitted
with wool from right hand in the usual English way, but keep the
lighter coloured wool over finger on <i>left</i> hand, and take it up as
the Germans always knit. This sounds troublesome, but is really quite
easy with a little practice.</p>

<p>Another simple but useful direction in knitting with wool carried on
at the back I must give.</p>

<p>When you knit 6 or more stitches with one colour, to avoid too long a
loop at the back, which is apt to get pulled, at the 3rd or 4th stitch
lay the wool you are <i>not</i> using level with your needle so as to come
above or rather <i>between</i> the needle and the wool you are going to
knit with. When the stitch is knitted, you will find the wool caught
lightly through at the back.</p>

<p class="center fb1 p4">KNICKERBOCKER STOCKING WITH FANCY TOP. NO. 1.</p>

<p class="p2"><i>Required.</i>&mdash;4 needles No. 12, tested by Walker's Bell Gauge, 3 cuts
of Alloa yarn (heather mixture), ½ cut of red to correspond.</p>

<p>K stands for knit, P for purl.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>

<p>With heather mixture cast on 78 stitches, 26 on each needle. Knit 4
rounds of k 1, p 1 alternately.</p>

<p>Purl two rounds.</p>

<p>In the next round you use the two colours alternately. Don't break off
the wool until directed to do so.</p>

<div class="figcenter p2">
<img src="images/i07.jpg" width="650" height="434" alt="Fancy Top No. 1" />
</div>

<p class="p2">1st pattern round.&mdash;With red wool, k 4. Heather wool k 2, but in
knitting these put the wool <i>twice</i> round the needle instead of once
as in ordinary knitting; this is done to lengthen the stitch. Repeat.</p>

<p>2nd round.&mdash;<i>Red</i> wool, k 4, slip the 2 knitted stitches on to the
same needle, letting the wool drop to make a long stitch. When you
slip, put in needle, as if to purl, from right to left. Repeat.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>

<p>3rd, 4th, and 5th rounds.&mdash;Same as 2nd.</p>

<p>6th round.&mdash;<i>Heather</i> wool. Knit all.</p>

<p>7th and 8th rounds.&mdash;Purl all.</p>

<p>9th round.&mdash;<i>Red</i> wool, k 1, *, <i>heather</i> wool, k 2, putting wool
<i>twice</i> round needle, <i>red</i> wool, k 4, repeat from *, end with k 3
<i>red</i> wool.</p>

<p>10th, 11th, 12th and 13th rounds.&mdash;<i>Red</i> wool, k 1, *, slip 2, k 4,
repeat from *, end with k 3.</p>

<p>14th round.&mdash;<i>Heather</i> wool. Knit all.</p>

<p>15th and 16th rounds.&mdash;Purl all.</p>

<p>Repeat from 1st round <i>once</i> more.</p>

<p>Repeat up to 9th round <i>once</i>.</p>

<p>You will have 5 coloured squares. Break off red wool.</p>

<p>With heather wool k 1, p 1 alternately every round until your stocking
measures, from casting on, a length of <i>six</i> inches.</p>

<p class="center p2"><i>Stocking Leg</i></p>

<p>Before beginning to rib the stocking leg, you must turn what you have
knitted inside out to make the fancy top fall over correctly. Do this
and arrange your stitches as follows. Place 31 on 1st needle, which
will be called the <i>back</i> or heel needle, 24 on the 2nd, 23 on the 3rd
needle.</p>

<p>1st round.&mdash;P 2, k 2, p 2, k 2, p 2, k 3, knit 2 together, k 3, knit 2
together, k 1, *, p 2, k 2, p 2, k 2, p 2, k 9, repeat from *.</p>

<p>You will have 29 stitches on back needle, 76 in all.</p>

<p>2nd round.&mdash;* P 2, k 2, p 2, k 2, p 2, k 9, repeat from *.</p>

<p>This ribbing broad and narrow alternately is carried down the leg. In
future, directions are only given for the increasings and decreasings
made on the 1st or back needle.</p>

<p>Repeat the 2nd round until your stocking measures from casting on
<i>eight</i> inches.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>

<p class="center p2"><i>To increase for Calf of Leg</i></p>

<p>1st round.&mdash;Back needle. P 2, k 2, p 2, k 2, p 2, k 2, raise 1 (see
general directions), knit till within 2 of end of broad rib, when
raise 1, k 2, <i>etc.</i> By <i>etc.</i> please understand you are to knit the
ribs according to pattern rest of round.</p>

<p>Rib 5 rounds with 11 stitches in centre back needle, broad rib.</p>

<p>7th round.&mdash;Same as 1st.</p>

<p>Rib 5 rounds with 13 stitches in centre back, broad rib.</p>

<p>13th round.&mdash;Same as 1st.</p>

stocking measures <i>eleven</i> inches from casting on.</p>

<p class="center p2"><i>Decreasing</i></p>

<p>This is done <i>twice</i> in the round at first, afterwards only once.</p>

<p>1st round.&mdash;Back needle. P 2, k 2, p 2, k 2, p 2, k 2, knit two
together; knit until within 4 of end of this broad rib, when knit 2

<p>49th round.&mdash;P 2, k 2, p 1, p 2 together, etc.</p>

<p>This finishes the decreasings. You will have 10 stitches left on your
back needle, 57 stitches in all on the needles. Your decreasings will
have formed a good <b>V</b>-shaped slant.</p>

<p>Continue ribbing until the stocking measures, from casting on, 22
inches. You must not pull out the stocking, but place it flat on the
table and measure it with a rule.</p>

<p class="center p2"><i>Heel</i></p>

<p>Prepare for heel by ribbing to end of back needle, from next needle
knit off on back needle the broad rib of 9 stitches. Knit on a 2nd
needle the small ribs and 5 of the next broad rib stitches, in all 15
stitches. On a 3rd needle k 4 and next small ribs, 14 stitches in all.
Now pass the 9 stitches of broad rib on to the heel or back needle.
This gives you 28 stitches on the heel needle.</p>

<p>The heel is formed by knitting the heel needle backwards and forwards.</p>

<p>1st row.&mdash;Slip 1 (when you slip 1st stitch put in needle from right to
left), k 8, p 2, k 2, p 2, k 2, p 2, k 9, turn.</p>

<p>2nd row.&mdash;Slip 1, p 8, k 2, p 2, k 2, p 2, k 2, p 9, turn.</p>

<p>Repeat these <i>two</i> rows until you have knitted 30 rows.</p>

<p class="center p2"><i>To round Heel</i></p>

<p>1st row.&mdash;Slip 1, k 15, knit 2 together, k 1, turn.</p>

<p>2nd row.&mdash;Slip 1, p 5, purl 2 together, p 1, turn.</p>

<p>3rd row.&mdash;Slip 1, k 6, knit 2 together, k 1, turn.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>

<p>4th row.&mdash;Slip 1, p 7, purl 2 together, p 1, turn.</p>

<p>5th row.&mdash;Slip 1, k 8, knit 2 together, k 1, turn.</p>

<p>6th row.&mdash;Slip 1, p 9, purl 2 together, p 1, turn.</p>

<p>7th row.&mdash;Slip 1, k 10, knit 2 together, k 1, turn.</p>

<p>8th row.&mdash;Slip 1, p 11, purl 2 together, p 1, turn.</p>

<p>9th row.&mdash;Slip 1, k 12, knit 2 together, k 1, turn.</p>

<p>10th row.&mdash;Slip 1, p 13, purl 2 together, p 1, turn.</p>

<p>11th row.&mdash;Slip 1, k 14, knit 2 together, turn.</p>

<p>12th row.&mdash;Slip 1, p 14, purl 2 together. 16 stitches will be left on
the heel needle.</p>

<p class="center p2"><i>To form the Foot</i></p>

<p>This is done by taking up, and as you take up knitting through the
loops down side of length of heel. In taking up be particular to put
your needle through both sides of the loops.</p>

<p>1st side needle. Slip 1, k 15 (these are the heel stitches). Take up,
and as you take up knit 17 stitches down side of heel. Purl 2 stitches
off next needle on this 1st side needle. With a 2nd needle rib all the
stitches on the next two needles but the <i>two</i> last. This needle is
henceforward called the instep needle. On a 3rd needle purl the 2
stitches left, and with it take up, and as you take up knit 17
stitches down other side of heel, also knit on to it 8 stitches off
the 1st side needle; these 8 are the half of the heel stitches left
after rounding it.</p>

<p>Count loops on your needles. You ought to have 27 on each side needle,
25 on the instep needle.</p>

<p class="center p2 p2"><i>To shape the Foot</i></p>

<p>1st round.&mdash;1st side needle. Knit plain until within 4 stitches of end
of needle, when knit 2 together, p 2.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span></p>

<p>Instep needle. K 2, p 2, k 2, p 2, k 9, p 2, k 2, p 2, k 2. 2nd side
needle. P 2, knit 2 together, knit to end of needle.</p>

<p>Repeat this round four times. You will have 23 stitches left on each
side needle.</p>

<p>5th round.&mdash;1st side needle. Knit all but 2 last, which are purled.
Instep needle. Rib according to pattern. 2nd side needle. P 2, knit
the rest.</p>

<p>6th round.&mdash;Same as 1st.</p>

<p>Repeat 5th and 6th rounds until you have only 16 stitches left on each
side needle, 25 on instep needle, 57 in all.</p>

<p>Repeat the 5th round until your foot measures, including the heel,
8½inches.</p>

<p class="center p2"><i>Toe</i></p>

<p>Prepare for toe by knitting to end of instep needle, and on that
needle knit 2 stitches off the next.</p>

<p>Next needle. Knit plain. 3rd needle. Knit to within 5 stitches of end,
when knit 2 together, k 2, and pass the last stitch on to instep
needle. You will have 28 stitches on instep needle, 14 on each of the
others.</p>

<p class="center p2"><i>To decrease the Toe</i></p>

<p>1st round.&mdash;Instep needle. K 2, knit 2 together, knit to within 4 of
end, when knit 2 together, k 2. Next needle. Knit 2, knit 2 together,
knit to end. 3rd needle. Knit to within 4 of end, knit 2 together, k
2.</p>

<p>2nd, 3rd and 4th rounds.&mdash;Knit all.</p>

<p>Repeat these 4 rounds <i>twice</i> more.</p>

<p>13th round.&mdash;Same as 1st.</p>

<p>14th and 15th rounds.&mdash;Knit all.</p>

<p>Repeat 13th, 14th and 15th rounds <i>once</i> more.</p>

<p>19th round.&mdash;Same as 1st.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>

<p>Repeat this until you have only 8 stitches left on the instep and 8 on
back needles, 16 in all.</p>

<p>Slip the back 8 stitches on one needle, knit the back and front
needles together, casting off at the same time.</p>

<p class="center fb1 p4">STOCKING, NO. 1.&mdash;PLAIN TOP</p>

<p>Cast on same number of stitches as for fancy top.</p>

<p>Rib, by k 1, p 1 alternately, or k 3, p 3 alternately a length of six
inches from casting on. You do not need with plain top to turn your
stocking inside out, as both sides are alike. Arrange your stitches as
directed for "stocking leg," and follow out the pattern.</p>

<p class="center fb1 p4">STOCKING, NO. 2</p>

<p><i>Required.</i>&mdash;4 needles No. 12, 2½ cuts of blue speckled Alloa yarn,

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
